The stoppage, which began Wednesday, was sparked by the Chinese government’s decision to raise fuel prices, as well as earlier increases in fees the drivers thought were unfair.  On Friday, the protests showed signs of boiling over into violence, with rumors spreading of a tough police crackdown.  The Wall Street Journal asked me about the relationship between the strike and inflation in China, which rose to 5.4% in March:  “It’s a sign of rising tensions and people are finding it more difficult to make ends meet,” said Patrick Chovanec, an associate professor at Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management in Beijing. He said the government’s recent decision to raise state-set fuel prices at a time when food and housing prices are already climbing was partially driving the truckers’ concerns. “If you do that in an environment where people are already stressed out about rising prices then it can create a very volatile situation.”  Canada’s Globe and Mail asked me the same question, as well as whether the strike could spill over into broader unrest:  “There is a strong feeling that the cost of living is rising and it’s cutting into people’s real gains from a growing economy,” said Patrick Chovanec, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing.  “It’s of great concern if it becomes part of a trend. There are localized protests nearly every day about all kinds of issues, but this is one where the pressures are likely to grow in intensity in the days ahead, and everyone – including the Chinese government – will be watching to see how people respond and whether frustration boils over,” Mr. Chovanec said.  My comments are fine as they stand, but I feel I should offer a little more context for those who are following the situation in China more closely.  The standard measure of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), includes both food and fuel in the “shopping basket” of prices it measures.  Food, however, is often subject to “price shocks” — sudden spikes in prices — because of temporary shortages due to weather or similar supply disruptions.  Oil, which most industrialized countries are required to import, is even more subject to volatile price fluctuations due to war, unrest, environmental disasters, or any other number of other causes that are completely external to the management of the domestic economy.  As a result, many economists argue that it is better to look at “core CPI” — CPI minus the food and fuel component — for a better measure of the underlying inflationary pressure in an economy.  I would argue that food, and possibly fuel, should not always be discounted quite so easily, especially if inflationary demand is pushing up prices broadly — as I think is happening in China today.  However, it’s important to note that recent spikes in oil prices, due to the unrest in Libya and other Arab states, is distinct from China’s homegrown inflation problem and is something beyond Chinese policymakers’ immediate control (although it’s equally fair to note that the broader pressure behind rising oil prices more generally is being driven, in large part, by the growing appetite of China and other rapidly emerging markets for oil imports — a demand which may be inflated by China’s expansive monetary policy).  It’s also important to realize that in China, fuel prices at the pump, for both gasoline and diesel, are set by the government — specifically, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) – not the market.  That’s actually not that unusual for developing countries, which frequently set fuel (and food) prices artificially low to make it more affordable for lower-income people.  The problem, of course, is that when oil prices spike, and those cost increases aren’t reflected at the pump, somebody needs to cover the difference.  Back before the global financial crisis, when oil prices were reaching $160/barrel, the Chinese government originally tried to force its state-owned oil companies, which import and refine over half of China’s petroleum supplies, to operate and sell fuel at a loss.  The losses were pretty staggering, and soon the oil companies were dragging their heels, shutting down refineries for “temporary maintenance” to stem the bleeding and creating fuel shortages.  Eventually, the NDRC agreed to directly subsidize the oil companies.  When oil prices dropped, the immediate crisis passed, but the episode appeared to convince the NDRC that, in the future, it needed a more flexible pricing framework for passing along higher oil prices to consumers (I actually did a show on this topic on Chinese TV back in May 2009, which you can watch here).  So in many ways, the Chinese government raising fuel prices to reflect the rising global price for oil is a good thing — but it’s also a painful thing for Chinese consumers who, unlike American drivers, aren’t used to seeing fuel prices rise and fall with the market.  Chinese drivers — including the truck drivers in Shanghai, as well as taxi drivers across the country — have been insulated from such forces, and being exposed to them — which is healthy for the economy as a whole — comes as a rude awakening.  The point, though, is that this “rude awakening” comes at a time when the typical Chinese citizen is feeling pressure to make ends meet from rising prices across the board, due to an over-expansive monetary policy.  The real problem with inflation isn’t that price rise — if all prices rose the same amount simultaneously, and the value of all obligations were adjusted accordingly, inflation would have no real effect on anyone.  You’d just a few zeros to every number and life would go on like before.  The problem is that prices rise unevenly.  Some people get to charge more while paying less.  Other people get squeezed — they have to pay more but are unable to pass those costs along.  Government-imposed price controls, which are supposed to help, sometimes make things worse by interfering with the ability of market participants to adjust prices to accommodate their costs.   When profit margins get squeezed — either due to price controls or just the uneven adjustment path of inflation — and companies can’t pass higher costs along to consumers, they start looking for ways to push costs down onto suppliers — particularly more vulnerable ones, like truckers.  I suspect, but can’t prove, that’s probably part of what we’re seeing.  Besides complaining about the fuel price hike, truckers have been complaining about new fees that have been imposed on them (to cover the port’s and logistic operators’ higher costs, no doubt) as well as the fact that their wages haven’t kept pace with the rising cost of living.  It sounds, to me, like a classic inflationary squeeze — and we’re likely to see more of it, in other sectors, as the Chinese economy struggles to adjust to the flood of money that’s been unleashed over the last couple of years.   By the way, on Friday, the Blue Ocean Network (BON-TV) aired an episode of Chinalogue, their current affairs show, featuring a more general discussion of Chinese inflation, its causes, and its consequences, between me and Professor Huo Deming of Peking University.

Besides complaining about the fuel price hike, truckers have been complaining about new fees that have been imposed on them (to cover the port’s and logistic operators’ higher costs, no doubt) as well as the fact that their wages haven’t kept pace with the rising cost of living.  It sounds, to me, like a classic inflationary squeeze — and we’re likely to see more of it, in other sectors, as the Chinese economy struggles to adjust to the flood of money that’s been unleashed over the last couple of years.

Aritonang The Jakarta Post Jakarta   /   Fri, April 17, 2020   /   03:45 pm We'll be back: Laborers from the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions (KSPI) protest against the controversial Omnibus bill on job creation in front of the House of Representatives in Jakarta on Feb. 12. Labor unions plan to return to the streets to protest the bill on April 30, despite the risk of contracting COVID-19. (JP/Dhoni Setiawan) 0 SHARES Darsih, a 41-year-old single mother of two, spent more than a year fighting for her right to severance pay after she was laid off in October 2018. At the time, she was working for a South Korean garment factory operating in North Jakarta. She was one of hundreds of workers who were laid off for the sake of cost efficiency. Even after months of battling it out through legal channels with the help of the Inter-Factory Laborers Federation (FBLP), Darsih still lost her appeal. But her focus held steady on the struggle. She was well aware of what little chance factory workers had to win a battle for rights against corporations. The fact that the government has moved in favor of investment has made the fight that much harder. Read also: Key points of labor reform in omnibus bill on job creation “Winning is just a reward,” Darsih said. “I have learned a lot about the labor movement, including the hard work and commitment needed to fight for my right as a worker,” she told The Jakarta Post last weekend. Now with the COVID-19 outbreak looming over her struggle, Darsih said the sense of community she gained from joining the FBLP had been crucial for her survival, since there were few opportunities for someone like her to get a formal education. Darsih is one of 40 FBLP members whose source of income evaporated as a result of the pandemic, joining more than a million others nationwide. Weeks ago, she was still able to run her mobile café, serving coffee and tea to workers at public facilities and malls around North Jakarta on her motorcycle. Now, she can no longer do that because of the large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) imposed by the government in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19. She and other union members who lost their jobs have set up a small home industry to produce fabric face masks in order to survive, as they have had little luck with social aid programs. FBLP is not alone in the struggle to support dismissed workers and their families on a daily basis. Other labor unions, including an alliance of the country’s three biggest groups, who all supported President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo – the Workers Union Confederation (KSPI), the All-Indonesia Workers Union Confederation (KSPSI) and the Indonesia Welfare Labor Confederation (KSBSI) – face the same problems. Desperation has fueled anger about the government’s insistence on continuing to deliberate the omnibus bill on job creation at a time when people have been told to stay at home. Now workers may be bold enough to risk catching COVID-19. They plan to stage massive rallies in front of executive and legislative offices nationwide on April 30. “The option is either to die from the coronavirus for joining a rally or die of starvation for having nothing to eat,” FBLP chairwoman Jumisih said on Monday.

Gejayan in Sleman, Yogyakarta, on March 9. Workers have widely opposed the omnibus bill on job creation for impinging upon labor rights. (JP/Bambang Muryanto) Rallies at the House complex were initially planned by the big-three unions at the end of March, but the police urged them to postpone and obey the state-led stay-at-home order. They were also briefly persuaded that progress on the bill would be delayed after several political leaders, including House speaker Puan Maharani of the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), questioned the need to rush the process. Much to their surprise, lawmakers moved to proceed with the bill’s deliberation, a decision announced by House Deputy Speaker Azis Syamsuddin, a Golkar Party lawmaker, during a House plenary session earlier this month. Azis claims the President himself gave the green light for the discussions. “We urge lawmakers to stop the deliberation [process]. President Jokowi must immediately retract the bill from the House,” said KSPSI chairman Andi Ghani Nuwa Wea. “Our members nationwide are getting ready to rally, and I can assure you that they are prepared to die.” Read also: PDI-P, NasDem call to remove labor provisions from omnibus jobs bill The insistence of politicians from the ruling coalition on continuing the talks in private has raised concerns about the motivation behind the omnibus bill. Lawmakers and officials have argued that the bill is required to boost investment, but labor unions consider that the hasty political horse trade occurring behind the curtain of physical distancing serves a single purpose: to provide companies a way out of honoring their responsibilities to their workers. The leaders of several progressive labor unions, including FBLP, KSPSI and the Congress Alliance of Indonesian Labor Unions (KASBI) said that both officials and lawmakers were using the COVID-19 crisis to “legitimize the exploitation of workers”. “While we are hard at work pushing firms to hand over severance pay to workers already laid off, the government and lawmakers are working fast to pass a bill that allows them to easily lay off even more people,” said KASBI chair Nining Elitos. According to Manpower Ministry data, more than a million workers have been laid off or furloughed since the COVID-19 outbreak took hold in the country. An estimated 5.2 million more workers could still lose their jobs.

It involves pitting [individual] workers against entire companies, so how can you expect a fair fight?” Jumisih said. Responding to mounting protests, leaders of the House Legislation Body (Baleg) tasked with negotiating the bill have pledged to remain transparent and accountable, with promises to broadcast all the meetings publicly on the legislature’s television channel and its social media accounts. “We also promise to invite the unions to participate in the meetings, whether virtually or face-to-face,” said Baleg chairman Supratman Andi Atgas of the Gerindra Party. However, backroom talks remain unsupervised.

Another meeting on April 14 was broadcast for the first 30 minutes before it was switched with a parallel program led by Golkar’s Azis detailing solutions that firms have come up with.

The demonstration came days after a large rally in Jerusalem Thursday night turned violent, as hundreds demonstrated against racism following the police beating of an Israeli soldier from the Ethiopian community.  Sunday’s rally commenced at the city’s iconic Azrieli Center at 3 p.m. and was followed by a march toward the bustling Ayalon highway, where protesters blocked the city’s major north-south artery.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top storiesFREE SIGN UP Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Sunday’s protest was mostly peaceful, though several arrests were made, according to media reports. Protesters chanted “Violent police officers belong in jail.”  Media reports put the number of protesters at several thousand strong.  The protesters were expected to make their way to the central Rabin Square.  Thousands of people rallying against racism and police brutality in central Tel Aviv on May 3, 2015.

(screen capture: Channel 2) The Zionist Union’s MK Stav Shaffir, and former Yesh Atid MK Pnina Tamano-Shata — the first female Ethiopian-born Knesset member — were in attendance at the rally.  “The young generation that grew up in Israel is demanding, rightfully, equal opportunity,” Tamano-Shata told Army Radio. “It is fed up with being discriminated against from a young age.”  “We want to show people that racism is not routine, and that is why we will disrupt their routines — to make them understand that,” activist Inbar Bolgleh told Channel 2 before the event.     “We are Israelis, just like everyone else. A large portion of Ethiopian immigrants are people who were born here and they deserve their rights,” said another activist, Spiano Malko, according to the news site Ynet.  While no official group took charge of organizing the rally, word of the protest spread quickly online over the weekend. Activists on Facebook called on demonstrators to bring cameras and smartphones in order to document any cases of brutality that might be directed at the protesters.  The protesters were galvanized by the publication of a video of an Ethiopian-Israeli soldier being beaten by police in the coastal city of Bat Yam, apparently without provocation. The footage sparked widespread anger in the community and prompted a surge of accusations of lingering institutional discrimination and racism.

(Photo credit: Yonatan SIndel/FLASH90) At Thursday’s protest in Jerusalem, which was officially staged in order to highlight police brutality against members of Israel’s Ethiopian community, police deployed tear gas, stun grenades and water hoses against the protesters. Meanwhile, pockets of demonstrators threw stones and bottles at police and blocked streets as well as the city’s light rail tracks as they attempted to march on the Prime Minister’s Residence.  Three police officers were injured at the protest, along with as many as 13 demonstrators. Two were arrested. Shortly after 1 a.m. Friday, the last of the protesters went home.

(Photo credit: Yonatan SIndel/Flash90) “You will see these protests in every city,” a masked activist told Channel 2 during the demonstration. He explained that he chose to obscure his face to prevent police from identifying him, because “I am afraid of them. Maybe they’ll find me and beat me up when the cameras aren’t around.”  “For years we’ve been putting up with this racism, and the pressure cooker is exploding,” another protester told the Walla news website.  On Friday, Israel Police Commissioner Yohanan Danino defended the officers involved in the clashes with Ethiopian Israelis during the Jerusalem demonstration, insisting that they responded with “restraint” to violence directed at them. “I would like to commend the Jerusalem District and backup officers for the restraint they exhibited,” he said in a letter to officers. Still, police officials said that they had not been sufficiently prepared for the number of protesters who attended the Jerusalem demonstration, Channel 10 reported.

(Photo credit: Miriam Alster/Flash90.) The police have been trying to soothe the resentment in the Ethiopian community over perceived racist and brutal treatment. Channel 2 news reported Friday night that officials planned to review charges against members of the community and withdraw cases in which police conduct was in question.  The demonstration in the capital came in wake of video footage that emerged Monday showing policemen beating an Ethiopian-born IDF soldier, Damas Pakada, who claimed later to have been the target of a racist attack.  “Apparently the streets of Israel must burn like they do in Baltimore in order for someone to finally wake up. The apartheid regime is back, this time in 21st-century Israel,” Gadi Yevarkan, head of the Campaign for Equality for Ethiopian Jews, told Ynet. “To see a soldier in uniform beaten by policemen in uniform is confirmation of official policy that allows police to beat blacks without having to be accountable to state laws,” he said.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ELlpRX3i7s  Pakada, a 21-year-old orphan who emigrated from Ethiopia with his four siblings seven years ago, told Channel 10 that he was riding his bicycle when he noticed the two officers. He said that he asked them what they were up to and one of them confronted him and pushed him off his bike, saying, “I can do whatever I want.”  He said that the officer threatened to shoot him in the head, and that they only let up after he backed away and lifted a rock. Several police officers then detained the soldier for alleged assault, although the footage showed that Pakada did not attack them with the rock in his hand. After the footage was obtained by Pakada’s family, he was released from custody, with police promising to investigate the matter.

(photo credit: Hadas Parush/FLASH90) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin have both condemned the beating of the soldier, but Netanyahu also urged dialogue rather than violence in dealing with the issues raised by the protesters.  Danino, for his part, said that the officer who was filmed beating the Pakada would be expelled from the police force, pending a hearing. “There is no room for such officers in the Israel Police,” he said. On Thursday, Danino met activists from the Ethiopian community, and said he would establish a special team to examine the community’s claims and formulate ways to deal with the problem.
